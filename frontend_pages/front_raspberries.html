        <p>The site was created for a group of people involved in creativity, engineering and web development.<br><br>
           The site is a simple block system with an obvious separation of elements. This reflects the conciseness and
           ergonomics of the decisions made by the "Raspberries" group.<br><br>
           In this project, I was involved in both development of graphic design and code.<br><br>
           Particular attention was paid to the adaptability of the website, which was implemented
           using media queries.<br><br>
