        <p>The mashup "Береги себя моя, двухэтажка" (Take care of yourself, my two-story building) created with
           the participation of the musical group Zhuhliy Hrustalic, received an original illustration, which became
           the cover of the album.<br><br>
           The cover is based on a poster for Yuri Bykov's film "Fool" with an additional collage of the brutal
           landscape of post-Soviet bedroom community.
