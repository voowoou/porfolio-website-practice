        <p>A meme that has become a clothing line and a recognizable brand.<br><br>
           The story began with hunger and the old flatbed scanner Сanon СanoScan. I just decided to scan all
           the things that were on my desk.<br><br>
           Then I got hungry and before eating the banana (that was nearby) I decided to scan it too.<br><br>
           After various manipulations in the smartphone graphic editor, I left only the most recognizable details
           of the banana, calling this picture "Figure 1. Just a banana (We ate it then) ".
